Hey there!

Resubmitting after first two submissions got automatically archived. Now use a different "trick" to not use more than two parallel cores during testing, fixed the URLs that I apparently missed, and removed the VignetteBuilder field in the DESCRIPTION. The two possibly misspelled words remain, but both are correct ('Libre' and 'LimeSurvey').

Thank you *very much* for all your work on CRAN!!!

And have a great 2022!

Kind regards,

Gjalt-Jorn

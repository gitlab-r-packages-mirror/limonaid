Hey there!

Resubmitting after first submission got automatically archived; apparently the 'trick' I used to detect whether CRAN tests were being ran, and subsequently limiting the number of parallel cores to use to 2, didn't work. Now created an option to set a max number of cores and setting that before testing. Also fixed the URLs that I apparently missed.

Thank you *very much* for all your work on CRAN!!!

And have a great 2022!

Kind regards,

Gjalt-Jorn

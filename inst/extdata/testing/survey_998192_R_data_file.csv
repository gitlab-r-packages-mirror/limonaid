"Response ID","Date submitted","Last page","Start language","Seed","Date started","Date last action","Dear colleague,  In the context of my graduation assignment, I am conducting research within the Open University on the theme 'resilience of employees’. Resilience is important both for the organization and for the employee. Resilience ensures that both the organization and her employees can thrive in an environment that is subject to change.  The study consists of 2 measurements. This is the second (and last) measurement!  The questionnaire relates to your current situation. Answering the questions does not take more than twenty minutes. There are no 'good' or 'wrong' answers: it is your opinion that counts. If in doubt, you may choose the answer that best fits your experience.  Your cooperation is important for the success of this research. You can cancel your participation at any time. I want to emphasize that the answers are treated confidentially, and only analyzed at an aggregate level for scientific purposes.  For further questions about this research, please contact L...... This can be done before, during, or after the research.  Prior to completing the questionnaire, I ask you to confirm that you have received this information and you agree to participate.
